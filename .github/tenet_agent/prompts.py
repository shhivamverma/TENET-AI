Focus on:
- Prompt injection or jailbreak vectors in detection logic
- Hardcoded secrets, API keys, or tokens
- Missing input sanitization / validation
- Unsafe use of `eval`, `exec`, `subprocess`, etc.
- Insecure dependencies or use of outdated library functions
- Improper error handling that leaks sensitive info

### 🧹 Code Quality
*List code quality issues (max 5). If none, write "Code quality looks good."*
- `file.py` - Description and suggestion.

### ✅ What's Done Well

Before writing any code, answer these questions clearly:

1. **Root Cause / Requirement**: What exactly needs to be changed or added?
2. **Files to Modify**: List the exact file paths that need changes (be precise).
3. **Files to Create**: List any new files needed (with full paths).
4. **Approach**: Briefly describe your implementation strategy (2-4 sentences).

## Output Format
For EACH file that needs to be modified or created, output a block in this EXACT format:

### FILE: path/to/file.py
```python
<complete file content here - do NOT use diffs, write the full file>
```

Rules:
- Write complete file contents (not partial snippets or diffs)
- Preserve all existing functionality unless the issue requires removing it
- Add clear inline comments explaining TENET-specific logic
- Follow the existing code style (Python type hints, docstrings, etc.)
- Keep security best practices (no hardcoded secrets, validate inputs, etc.)
- After all FILE blocks, write a short **Commit Message** (one line, imperative mood)

If you cannot confidently generate a fix (e.g., issue is too vague or requires \
human judgment), output a single block:
### CANNOT_FIX
<explanation of why and what additional info is needed>
